    "Title": "Coloring molecules for plasma protein binding prediction",
    "Description": "By combining a Message-Passing Graph Neural Network (MPGNN) and a Forward fully connected Neural Network (FNN) with an integrated gradients explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) method, the authors developed MolGrad and tested it on a number of ADME predictive tasks. MolGrad incorporates explainable features to facilitate interpretation of the predictions. In this model, they train MolGrad with data from a Plasma-protein binding assay (PPB) to predict the fraction bound in plasma of small molecules.\n",
